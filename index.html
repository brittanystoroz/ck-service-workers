<h2>About "Modular Content Kit"-s</h2>

<p>Not all audiences are created equal - so not all presentations, workshops should be the same as well.</p>

<p>Modular content kits consist of several, smaller chunks of talks, slides, workshop parts.
  When speakers know the audience of there talk beforehand, they could easily mix-and-match the different parts to give the best fitting talk/service to their audience.<br>
  Being able to compose one's presentation from smaller chunks can also prove great when the event schedule &amp; circumstances require fitting the presentation into a tighter time limit.
</p>


<h2>Learning objectives</h2>

<p>After you present or teach this content kit, your audience will know how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A short 5 to 15 minute talk or intro composed of the content kit's intro modules is great for:
    <ul>
      <li>Introducing service workers for non-technical audiences, share the vision/possibilities they enable in the future</li>
      <li>Demonstrate basic usage and show possibilities for technical audiences</li>
      <li>Teach service worker basics &amp; intro to usage to audiences familiar with JavaScript-programming</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Deep-dive modules could be then used to elaborate on a subject matter like (for audiences familiar with code)
    <ul>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
